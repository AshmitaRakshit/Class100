oops-python is object oriented 
in python 
__init__ is a predefined function in python and it is similar to constructor in javascript.
It is called whenever we create an object using the class

self - its similar to 'this' keyword in javascript
Python does not need keyword 'new'
You can create new objects using the class by using the class name
